# webflux-security-jwt-jwks 
- [sample guide](https://github.com/rwinch/spring-enterprise-authorization-server/tree/main/simple-jwt)
- To generate private and public RSA256 public and private key
```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f jwtRS256.key
# Don't add passphrase
openssl rsa -in jwtRS256.key -pubout -outform PEM -out jwtRS256.key.pub
cat jwtRS256.key
cat jwtRS256.key.pub

```

To create the image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app like any other container:

```
$ docker run --rm webflux-security-jwt-jwks:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

### Executable with Native Build Tools
Use this option if you want to explore more options such as running your tests in a native image.
The GraalVM `native-image` compiler should be installed and configured on your machine.

NOTE: GraalVM 22.3+ is required.

To create the executable, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw native:compile -Pnative
```

Then, you can run the app as follows:
```
$ target/webflux-security-jwt-jwks
```

You can also run your existing tests suite in a native image.
This is an efficient way to validate the compatibility of your application.

To run your existing tests in a native image, run the following goal:

```
$ ./mvnw test -PnativeTest
```
